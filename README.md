# starred-github-repositories
Programs to plot the most-starred GitHub repositories according to Python or Java language.

These programs were motivated by Eric Matthes's "Python Crash Course" which was an extremely fun guide to programming in Python. In addition to the use of Python to access GitHub's API to determine the most-starred repositories using Python, I also added one for Java.

The corresponding .svg files were made by executing the respective Python programs on 12/9/18.
